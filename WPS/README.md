# Work Packages (Flat)

This folder replaces the earlier nested WPS structure with a **single flat list** of 12 files:

- WP01: Project Structure & Tooling Sanity (Flatten WPS, README refresh)
- WP02: Product Strategy (Edge vs Competitors)
- WP03: Competition & Positioning (Pure Storage & Peers)
- WP04: Commercials: Pricing, Packaging, Cash-Flow Model
- WP05: Core API & C# SDK (Minimal Demo Path)
- WP06: C ABI & C SDK (Stable Interop Contracts)
- WP07: C++ SDK & Bindings (High-Perf Clients)
- WP08: Data Model, Schemas, Migrations
- WP09: Security, Compliance & SPI Readiness
- WP10: Performance Benchmarks, SLOs & Tuning
- WP11: V&V Test Automation & CI Gates
- WP12: Demo Prep, Docs & GTM Ready

## Ground Rules
- One file per WP: `WPxx_Title.md`
- Keep sections consistent across WPs (template included in each file)
- Update **Status**, **Priority**, and **Milestones** as you progress
- Link code artefacts under `ZEN/` and docs under `Strategy/`, `Competition/`, `Commercials/`
